## 📱 Overview
This repository contains the complete solution for **Mobile Application Development – Quiz #1**.  
The quiz focuses on **Dart Basics** and **Flutter State Management**, implemented using Android Studio and Flutter SDK.

The project includes **two separate questions**, each built as a Flutter screen with navigation from a home menu.

---

## 🧮 Question #1 – Flutter State Management (05 Marks)
Create a Flutter app that shows a counter value starting from `0`.  
- Add a button labeled **“Add 10”** that increases the counter by 10 each time it is pressed.  
- Implemented using **StatefulWidget** and **setState()** for state management.

**File:** `lib/quiz1_counter.dart`  
**Key Concepts:** `StatefulWidget`, `setState`, UI updates, button interaction.

---

## 🔢 Question #2 – Dart Basics: Lists & Conditions (05 Marks)
Write a Dart program that:  
1. Takes **input of 6 integers** from the user.  
2. Prints the following:  
   - The **sum of odd numbers**.  
   - The **smallest number** in the list.  

**File:** `lib/quiz2_list_conditions.dart`  
**Key Concepts:** Lists, parsing input, iteration, conditions, and aggregation in Dart.
